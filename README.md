# What the hell is this all about?

Well in case you have a girl friend that is Czech speaker and 
not entirely comfortable wathing TV shows with original audio
without subtitles, this is for you.

This tiny tiny script (I was even lazy to make a class in the only ruby file 
    this repo has) downloads subtitles from http://serialzone.cz 


## Installation

You will probably have to run 

`bundle install` 

To fetch dependencies


## Usage

Just run `ruby subs.rb arrow s01e01` to download all availabe subtitles
for Arrow episode 1 of season 1

If you wont specify the second argument it will download all available 
subtitles for the show


## TODO

[ ] Specify location
[ ] Polish the 10 minute code
[ ] Ruby Gem? :D
